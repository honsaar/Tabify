# Tabify
> Spotify + Tabs

Todo: Make a better app name

## Installation
Clone the repo and open in your code editor. No fancy NPM installs required; all the code is frontend-only.

### How do I test it then?

Make your changes, then push it to the `Master` branch of this repo. Then go to [tabify.netlify.com](https://tabify.netlify.com) to test it. We require a hosted instance of this for the callbacks to work. **Netlify** is a static hosting service that automatically deploys each time we make a push to this git repo.

For now it's just deploying using the `Master` branch, but we can update that later as we create dev branches if required. (*Note: We will need to update the Spotify App Dashboard to also accept these additional callback URIs*)

## Future Ideas
- *Not everyone uses Spotify, what APIs exist for SoundCloud and Apple Music?*

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi
THEY EXIST
